# INTC 3083 - Computer Programming I

We will be using the `Python` programming language to cover this course.

## Python Programming Language

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is an [interpreted](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-compiled-and-interpreted-language/), [object-oriented](https://searchapparchitecture.techtarget.com/definition/object-oriented-programming-OOP), [high-level](https://www.webopedia.com/definitions/high-level-language/) programming language.

## IDE

We will be using `Visual Studio Code (VS Code)` by Microsoft as our [IDE](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-an-ide). `VS Code` is available on Windows, Mac, and Linux. It is **free**, **open source**, and has **extensions** that enable you to write code in different programming languages including `C`, `C++`, `C#`, `Java`, `Javascript`, `PHP`, `HTML`, `CSS`, `Python`, and more.
