# CS 101 - Introduction to Programming

We will be using the `Python` programming language to cover this course.  

## Setting Up Your Environment

You will need access to a Unix-based operating system for this class.
- macOS is UNIX compliant
- Linux (any variant i.e. Ubuntu)
- Windows using `WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)`

See [Setting Up Your Windows environment](doc/windows.md) if you are using a PC.  

## Python Programming Language

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is an `interpreted`, `object-oriented`, `high-level` programming language.

## IDE
The `Integrated Development Environment (IDE)` is software you use to write code. It has the advantage of combining many developer tools into a single `User Interface (UI)` for convenience and efficiency.

The `IDE` you will be using for this class is `Visual Studio Code (VSC)` by Microsoft. `VSC` is available on Windows, Mac, and Linux. It is free, open source, and has `extensions` that enable you to write code in different programming languages including C/C++/C#, Java, Javascript, PHP, HTML/CSS, Python, and more.

[Download Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  

## Common Developer Tools
You will need familiarity with the following tools, which are all integrated in `VSC`.
