# INTC 3083 - Computer Programming I

We will be using the `Python` programming language to cover this course.

## Python Programming Language

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is an **interpreted**, **object-oriented**, **high-level** programming language.

## IDE
The **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)** is a **software application** you use to write code. It has the advantage of combining many developer tools into a single **User Interface (UI)** for convenience and efficiency.

The **IDE** for this class is `Visual Studio Code (VS Code)` by Microsoft. `VS Code` is available on Windows, Mac, and Linux. It is **free**, **open source**, and has **extensions** that enable you to write code in different programming languages including `C`, `C++`, `C#`, `Java`, `Javascript`, `PHP`, `HTML`, `CSS`, `Python`, and more.
