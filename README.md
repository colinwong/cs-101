# INTC 3083 - Computer Programming I

We will be using the `Python` programming language to cover this course.

## Python Programming Language

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is an [interpreted](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-compiled-and-interpreted-language/), [object-oriented](https://searchapparchitecture.techtarget.com/definition/object-oriented-programming-OOP), [high-level](https://www.webopedia.com/definitions/high-level-language/) programming language.

## IDE

We will be using `Visual Studio Code (VS Code)` to write our code. `VS Code` is available on `Windows` / `Mac` / `Linux`, and is **free**, **open-source**, and enables you to write code in many programming languages including `C`, `C++`, `C#`, `Java`, `Javascript`, `PHP`, `HTML`, `CSS`, `Python`, and more.
