# Computer Programming I

Learn programming with `Python`.

## Python Programming Language

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is an [interpreted](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-compiled-and-interpreted-language/), [object-oriented](https://searchapparchitecture.techtarget.com/definition/object-oriented-programming-OOP), [high-level](https://www.webopedia.com/definitions/high-level-language/) programming language.

## Class IDE

We will use [Google Colab](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/) for in-class learning.

- No setup required.
- Instant feedback on tasks.
