# INTC 3083 - Computer Programming I

We will be using the `Python` programming language for this course.

## Python Programming Language

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is an [interpreted](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-compiled-and-interpreted-language/), [object-oriented](https://searchapparchitecture.techtarget.com/definition/object-oriented-programming-OOP), [high-level](https://www.webopedia.com/definitions/high-level-language/) programming language.

## IDE

We will use `Visual Studio Code (VS Code)` to write our code.

- Available on `Windows`, `Mac`, `Linux`
- Free & open source
- Supports `C`, `C++`, `C#`, `Java`, `Javascript`, `PHP`, `HTML`, `CSS`, `Python`, and more.
